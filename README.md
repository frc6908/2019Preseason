2019 Preseason code utilizing WPILib 2019 Alpha-4

# Environment Set-Up
Use the following [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gsHRuXv4nH3QgOnL0EUB5_rmLXk-JnR6QtYgkNwiXGk/edit?usp=sharing) as resource to setup your development environment.

# Building the Project
Open the Command Pallete using the `Ctrl+Shift+P` shortcut.
Type in `wpilib build` and you will be presented with the *Build* command provided by WPILib.
Hit `Enter` and the code will automatically build, and should return `Build Successful` if the environment has been setup correctly and there are no errors in the code.

# Deploying the Project to the RoboRio
Connect to the network provided by the radio on the robot.
Once connected, you can use the Command Pallete \(`Ctrl+Shift+P`\) and enter `wpilib deploy`. This function will deploy the code to the roboRio.
Another option is to use the keyboard shortcut `Shift+F5`. This calls the `WPILib Deploy` Command.
